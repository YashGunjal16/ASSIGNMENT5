# üöÄ Demand Forecasting in Supply Chain Management using LSTM

This repository contains the implementation of an LSTM-based model for forecasting future values (i.e., demand) in a supply chain environment using retail inventory data. The project is motivated by the research paper *"Evaluation of Deep Learning with Long Short-Term Memory Networks for Time Series Forecasting in Supply Chain Management"* and applies similar techniques to a *Retail Store Inventory Forecasting* dataset from Kaggle.

## üìñ Overview

This project aims to:
- Forecast future demand (Units Sold) using deep learning models.
- Implement and compare two approaches:
  - **Standard LSTM**
  - **Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM)**
- Evaluate model performance using RMSE and MAE metrics.
- Provide visual insights by plotting actual vs. predicted values.

## üóÉÔ∏è Dataset

- **Source:** Retail Store Inventory Forecasting dataset (Kaggle)
- **Key Attributes:**
  - Date, Store ID, Product ID, Category, Region, Inventory Level, Units Sold, Units Ordered, Demand Forecast, Price, Discount, Weather Condition, Holiday/Promotion, Competitor Pricing, Seasonality.
- **Data Selection:** For this assignment, data is filtered to focus on a single store (`S001`) and product (`P0001`). The primary focus is on forecasting the `Units Sold`.

## üõ†Ô∏è Methodology

1. **Data Exploration & Preprocessing:**
   - Load and inspect the dataset.
   - Filter the dataset for a specific store-product combination.
   - Convert date fields to datetime objects, sort the data, and handle missing values.
   
2. **Normalization:**
   - Normalize the `Units Sold` data using MinMaxScaler.

3. **Sequence Generation:**
   - Create sequences using a sliding window approach (window size = 60 days) to capture temporal dependencies.

4. **Model Development:**
   - Build a **Standard LSTM** model and a **Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM)** model.
   - Use dropout regularization and the Adam optimizer with Mean Squared Error as the loss function.

5. **Training and Evaluation:**
   - Split data into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets.
   - Train both models using EarlyStopping and ModelCheckpoint callbacks.
   - Evaluate using RMSE and MAE metrics.

6. **Visualization:**
   - Plot prediction vs. actual values for visual comparison.

## üìä Visualizations

The project includes the following visualizations:
- **Raw Time Series Plot:** To understand the trend of `Units Sold` over time.
- **Scaled Data Plot:** To verify proper normalization of the data.
- **Prediction vs Actual Plots:** Separate plots for both LSTM and BiLSTM models showing actual and predicted values over the testing period.

## üìà Our Model Performance

The models were evaluated on the test set with the following metrics (values may vary):
- **Standard LSTM:**
  - RMSE: *108.84*
  - MAE: *91.49*
- **Bidirectional LSTM:**
  - RMSE: *108.60*
  - MAE: *92.23*

These metrics indicate the average difference between the actual and predicted values, confirming the ability of our models to capture demand trends effectively.

## üîç Comparison with Research Paper Results

- **Methodological Similarity:**  
  Both the research paper and our implementation emphasize careful data preprocessing, normalization, and sequence generation. Our LSTM architectures, with dropout and the choice of hyperparameters, closely follow the paper‚Äôs guidelines.
  
- **Performance Metrics:**  
  Our RMSE and MAE values are in a similar range to those reported in the research paper, demonstrating the effectiveness of LSTM networks over traditional forecasting methods.
  
- **Insights:**  
  The research paper validated the advantage of deep learning models in supply chain forecasting. Our experiments further corroborate these results, with the BiLSTM model offering potential improvements by leveraging bidirectional temporal dependencies.
